■pip install azureはNG？
I was also getting the same original issue (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure.cognitiveservices') for the spellcheck functions. Do NOT pip install azure . It installs all of the subpackages and I have a feeling there is an overlap between them that is causing issues.

I couldn't easily remove all the sub packages so I wiped my environment, started fresh, and this time only installed the pack I wanted (in this case pip install azure-cognitiveservices-language-spellcheck).

Now I am able to from azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck import SpellCheckAPI without problem
